# CubeSat Hardware Development

## Goals
The overall goal is to build a 1U CubeSat with 3 reaction wheels, one mounted in its own plane, with a IMU, main motherboard controller, and batteries to power everything. Integrating all componets into a 100mm by 100mm by 100mm cube that has the ablility to be mounted into our external gimbal test stand.


## To-Do
### Mechanical 
- CubeSat CAD
| Declared | To-Do | Completed |
--- | --- | ---
| 2/8/22 | Design Rough Prototype of 1U CubeSat with motors, IMU, motherboard contoroller, and batteries. Get general idea of configuration of the differen parts and see how much space we have to work with.
| 2/8/22 | Agree upon best configuration, then, design mounting structures for all componets into CubeSat frame

- CubeSat 3D Print
| Declared | To-Do | Completed |
--- | --- | ---
| 2/8/22 | 3D print first prototype of the 1U CubeSat, Mount all componets to test fitment for improvement

### Electrical
- Battery
| Declared | To-Do | Completed |
--- | --- | ---
| 2/8/22 | Calculate how much current the motors will draw during operation to determine the C rating of the battery required and capacity required for desired runtime duration. |
| 2/8/22 | Analyze runing the motors at 12V vs 24V and which would be better for our system. |
| 2/8/22 | After Calculations of power requirement for the system choose the bet fit battery. |
| 2/8/22 | Determine battery BMS and required powermanagment circuit |

- Motherboard
| Declared | To-Do | Completed |
--- | --- | ---
| 2/8/22 | Decide weather an Arduino nano should be used paired with a raspberry pi zero w or can just the raspberrry pi support the control of all the required systems. |
