# CubeSat Hardware Development

## Goals
The overall goal is to build a 1U CubeSat with 3 reaction wheels, one mounted in its own plane, with a IMU, a photoresistor, n main motherboard controller, and batteries to power everything. Integrating all componets into a 100mm by 100mm by 100mm cube that has the ablility to be mounted into our external gimbal test stand.


## To-Do
### Mechanical 
- CubeSat CAD

| Declared | To-Do | Completed |
--- | --- | ---
| 2/8/22 | Design basic 1U CubeSat frame for tesing different connection methods to the gimbal |
| 2/8/22 | Design Rough Prototype of 1U CubeSat with motors, IMU, photoresistor, motherboard contoroller, and batteries. Get general idea of configuration of the differen parts and see how much space we have to work with. |
| 2/8/22 | Agree upon best configuration, then, design mounting structures for all componets into CubeSat frame |
| 2/8/22 | Design the motor mounting points, one on each plane |
| 2/8/22 | Design the IMU mounting points, in the center of the CubeSat |
| 2/8/22 | Design the IMU mounting points, in the center of the CubeSat |


- CubeSat 3D Print

| Declared | To-Do | Completed |
--- | --- | ---
| 2/8/22 | 3D print basic 1U CubeSat frame for tesing different connection methods to the gimbal |
| 2/8/22 | 3D print first prototype of the 1U CubeSat for testing componet mounts for fitment and improvement |
| 2/8/22 | Mount the IMU into 3D printed CubeSat prototype to ensure fitment and position |
| 2/8/22 | Mount all 3 motors into 3D printed CubeSat prototype to ensure fitment and position |
| 2/8/22 | Mount all photoresistors into 3D printed CubeSat prototype to ensure fitment and position |
| 2/8/22 | Mount all batteries into 3D printed CubeSat prototype to ensure fitment and position |
| 2/8/22 | Mount all electronics into 3D printed CubeSat prototype to ensure fitment and position |


### Electrical
- Battery

| Declared | To-Do | Completed |
--- | --- | ---
| 2/8/22 | Calculate how much current the motors will draw during operation to determine the C rating of the battery required and capacity required for desired runtime duration. |
| 2/8/22 | Analyze runing the motors at 12V vs 24V and which would be better for our system. |
| 2/8/22 | After Calculations of power requirement for the system choose the bet fit battery. |
| 2/8/22 | Determine battery BMS and required power managment circuit |


- Motherboard

| Declared | To-Do | Completed |
--- | --- | ---
| 2/8/22 | Decide weather an Arduino nano should be used paired with a raspberry pi zero w or can just the raspberrry pi support the control of all the required systems. |
