# CubeSat Attitude Raspberry Pi Control Software 

## Goals
The Raspberry Pi software will recive the IMU and photosensor data, and then be able to send commands to the motor function on the Arduino. This will allow for the CubeSat to be wirelessly controled through python code that can be uploaded through a website.
