# CubeSat Attitude Arduino Control Software 

## Goals
The Arduino software will have functions to read the IMU data, photosensor, and control the direction and speed of the motors in the CubeSat. It will aditionally need a function that is for communication between the Raspberry Pi to send the IMU data and photosensor data and recive the desired attitude and motor comands.
