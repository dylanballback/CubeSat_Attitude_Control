# 1 Degree of Freedom Reaction Wheel Control Prototype

## Goals
The goal of this is to first protoype how to balance a 1 degree of freedom system before jumping stright into a 6 degree of freedom system. This initial test will teach us how to operate a single motor and read IMU data. Additionally learning how to make a simple PID controller to balance a 1 Dof system. Allow us to measure how much energy is required with one motor in a single degree of freedom.

### 2/9/22
- Wired one Nidec 24H404H BLDC Motor to Arduino and wrote a program for it to spin in both directions. ([Basic Motor Test Code](https://github.com/dylanballback/CubeSat_Attitude_Control/blob/main/1DoF%20Prototype/Arduino/motor_test_basic/motor_test_basic.ino))

    Testing relationship between PWM duty cycle and motor speed with Osciliscope along with maximum PWM signal that can be sent.

- Got MPU6050 with Kalman Filter up and runing reliably with the Arduino. ([MPU6050 Kalmain Filter Code](https://github.com/dylanballback/CubeSat_Attitude_Control/blob/main/1DoF%20Prototype/Arduino/MPU6050_Kalman_Filter/MPU6050_Kalman_Filter.ino))

### 2/10/22
- Testing and data collection of RPM with relation to voltage and PWM signal using Encoder. ([Encoder RPM Test Code](https://github.com/dylanballback/CubeSat_Attitude_Control/blob/main/1DoF%20Prototype/Arduino/encoder_test/encoder_test.ino))
    <img src="https://github.com/dylanballback/CubeSat_Attitude_Control/blob/main/Images/1Dof_testbed/encoder_1Dof_test1.jpeg" width="400" >

- Attempted and wrote two non-working different versions of a PID controller. ( [Balance PID Code V1](https://github.com/dylanballback/CubeSat_Attitude_Control/blob/main/1DoF%20Prototype/Arduino/balance_V1/balance_V1.ino) )( [Balance PID Code V2](https://github.com/dylanballback/CubeSat_Attitude_Control/blob/main/1DoF%20Prototype/Arduino/balance_V2/balance_V2.ino))

- Found out I need to research more about PID tunning methods, and size and weight of the reaction wheel.

- Designed and printed version 2 of reaction wheel with increased radius and weight.
- Trying [Zieglerâ€“Nichols method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziegler%E2%80%93Nichols_method) for PID tunning.

### 2/11/22
- Achived a working PID program that maps out PWM values within operating range of the motor. ([Untuned Balance PID code V3](https://github.com/dylanballback/CubeSat_Attitude_Control/blob/main/1DoF%20Prototype/Arduino/balance_V3/balance_V3.ino))
