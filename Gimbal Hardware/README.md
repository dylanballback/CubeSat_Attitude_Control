# Gimbal test bed stand for CubeSat Hardware

## Goals
The goal of the gimbal is to design and build a system that a 1U CubeSat mounts inside and provide free rotations in 3 degrees of freedom. This test stand gimbal will allow for the 1U CubeSat to freely rotate in all 3 DoF for testing the attitude control using 3 reaction wheels.

### 3/3/22 
- Updated gimbal mounts to CubeSat frame using threaded inserts on the side frame of the CubeSat instead previously where I was mounting it from corners. Using this method will allow for the CubeSat frame itself will be easier to 3D print and rapidly iterated upon and not require new print everytime to mount to the gimbal.

### 3/4/22
- Designed and 3D printed a gimbal lock piece that snaps in place to lock the gimbal rings in place, this will allow for me to test the reaction wheel PID control of just a single axis in the gimbal mount.
