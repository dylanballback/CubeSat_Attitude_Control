# Gimbal test bed stand for CubeSat Hardware

## Goals
The goal of the gimbal is to design and build a system that a 1U CubeSat mounts inside and provide free rotations in 3 degrees of freedom. This test stand gimbal will allow for the 1U CubeSat to freely rotate in all 3 DoF for testing the attitude control using 3 reaction wheels.
