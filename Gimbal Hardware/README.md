# Gimbal test bed stand for CubeSat Hardware

## Goals
The goal of the gimbal is to design and build a system that a 1U CubeSat mounts inside and provide free rotations in 3 degrees of freedom. This test stand gimbal will allow for the 1U CubeSat to freely rotate in all 3 DoF for testing the attitude control using 3 reaction wheels.


## To-Do

### Gimbal CAD
| Declared | To-Do | Completed |
--- | --- | ---
| 2/8/22 | Design mounting mechanism to attach the 1U CubeSat to the inner ring |
| 2/8/22 | 3D print and test fitment of CubeSat connection to inner ring |
| 2/8/22 | Calculate and design the smallest inner ring possible |
| 2/8/22 | 3D print and test fitment of inner ring componets connection (if the ring is split into muiltiple prints) |
| 2/8/22 | Design the middle ring that can freely rotate around the inner ring |
| 2/8/22 | 3D print and test fitment of middle ring componets connection (if the ring is split into muiltiple prints) |
| 2/8/22 | Design the outter ring that can freely rotate around the middle ring |
| 2/8/22 | 3D print and test fitment of outter ring componets connection (if the ring is split into muiltiple prints) |
| 2/8/22 | Design the bearing mounts and connection between each ring |
| 2/8/22 | Test fitment of bearing componets into 3D printed ring and connection between the rings |
| 2/8/22 | Design outter ring external mounting points to be compatiable to monut to a 80/20 test stand |




### Gimbal Hardware
| Declared | To-Do | Completed |
--- | --- | ---
| 2/8/22 | Figure out the best bearings for the gimbal to allow for low friction rotation |
